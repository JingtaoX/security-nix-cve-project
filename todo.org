* Examples:
** TODO Basic Example: Curl
- [ ] Get the JSON working with curl installed at some specific version
- [ ] MAYBE? Also grab the =curl= at a specific version and provide a build environment for it
- [ ] See if this will work /automatically/ for other applications (i.e. wget) 

** TODO More complex example, server applications like NextCloud / Jenkins, etc
- [ ] The JSON in the CVE covers both the android / server versions of this app.. We only care about the server version
- [ ] Try to grab the version we care about

* Subgoals
** TODO Need someone to parse through the CVEV5s and grab the ones that we care about
- The JSON format should be fairly easy to parse using Python
- Someone try doing this
** TODO Categorize / Parse the version numbers from the CVEs
- This is *not trivial* - the format is kind of weird with the "default" and stuff
- Look at the Schema
- Given the format - I need the name of the software and an affected version!
** TODO Deal with a nix stuff as a program - the program should *compose* well with the previous step.
* Exploits to try
** TODO Shellcodes - this is very simple to try out:

** TODO 
* Things to pivot to
** TODO Generate a dataset based on the CVE tag
** TODO Figure out how to
